          <p>This list of the oldest living things on Earth, including the oldest animals, species, and organisms, will definitely make you feel young.</p>

          <p> 1. &nbsp;<b>Cyanobacteria</b>, or blue-green algae, of which fossils have been found dating back 4.5 billion years.</p>
           <p>2. &nbsp;<b>Sponges</b>, are from an ancient animal group whose lineage can be traced back to the beginnings of animal life. Fossils of glass sponges have been found in rocks in Australia, China, and Mongolia.</p>
           <p>3. &nbsp;<b>Jellyfish</b>, They are hard to fossilize, as they're made of mostly water, but fossils suggest they are even older than previously thought.</p>
           <p>4. &nbsp;<b>Horseshoe Crab</b>, are considered 'living fossils.' These marine arthropods live primarily near shallow ocean waters with soft, sandy or muddy bottoms.</p>
           <p>5. &nbsp;<b>Coelacanth</b>, A rare order of fish, coelacanths are more closely related to lungfish, reptiles and even mammals than to common ray-finned fish. Live species have been discovered as recently as 1998.</p>
           <p>6. &nbsp;<b>Gingko Biloba</b>, The Ginkgo tree is the only living representative of the order Ginkgoales, a group of gymnosperms dating back to 270 million years ago in the Permian period.</p>
           <p>7. &nbsp;<b>Nautilus</b>, Often called 'living fossils,' the nautilus originated in the Late Triassic period, and is a marine mollusk. The name means 'sailor' in Greek.</p>

    <p>extracted from 'The Top 10 Oldest Living Things on Earth' at www.ranker.com </p>
 <p> 1. &nbsp;<b>Cyanobacteria</b>, or blue-green algae, of which fossils have been fond dating back 4.5 billion years, is a type of bacteria that uses photosynthesis to create energy. It is believed that this played a role in oxidizing the earth's atmosphere, making the planet more suitable for life as we know it.</p>
           <p>2. &nbsp;<b>Sponges</b>, are from an ancient animal group whose lineage can be traced back to the beginnings of animal life. Fossils of glass sponges have been found in rocks in Australia, China, and Mongolia.</p>
           <p>3. &nbsp;<b>Jellyfish</b>, belong to the group of animals called Cnidaria or Coelenterata. This group includes corals, hydras, jellyfish, Portuguese men-of-war, sea anemones, sea pens, sea whips, and sea fans. They are hard to fossilize, as they're made of mostly water, but fossils suggest they are even older than previously thought.</p>
           <p>4. &nbsp;<b>Horseshoe Crab</b>, are considered 'living fossils.' The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are dated to the Ordovician period. These marine arthropods live primarily near shallow ocean waters with soft, sandy or muddy bottoms. Their populations have been in decline due to habitat destruction and over harvesting.</p>
           <p>5. &nbsp;<b>Coelacanth</b>, A rare order of fish, coelacanths are more closely related to lungfish, reptiles and even mammals than to common ray-finned fish. Live species have been discovered as recently as 1998.</p>
           <p>6. &nbsp;<b>Gingko Biloba</b>, The Ginkgo tree is the only living representative of the order Ginkgoales, a group of gymnosperms dating back to 270 million years ago in the Permian period. Due to geological cataclysms, only three or four species were left in the Tertiary period (65 million years ago). The extinction of the dinosaurs as potential seed dispersers of the tree's large seeds may also have influenced this decline, which is in line with the fossil records.</p>
           <p>7. &nbsp;<b>Nautilus</b>, Often called 'living fossils,'' the nautilus originated in the Late Triassic period, and is a marine mollusk. The name means 'sailor' in Greek. The nautilus is only found in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. They live in the deep slopes of coral reefs.</p>
           <p>8. &nbsp;<b>Horseshoe Shrimp</b>, This little guy has the distinction of being the oldest living species on earth that has existed unchanged for 200 million years. In other words, he may not have been around as long as some of the creatures above him, but today he's is still virtually indistinguishable from his 200 million year old fossil. </p>"
