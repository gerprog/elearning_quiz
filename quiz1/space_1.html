          data-title="<h1>Our Solar System</h1><p>Space, in its infinity and mystery has captivated humanity throughout the ages. We have learned that our Sun is a relatively middleaged star at 4.6 billion years. </p>

          <p>The Solar System comprises the Sun and the objects that orbit it, whether they orbit it directly or by orbiting other objects that orbit it directly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets that form the planetary system around it.</p>

          <p> The planets are positioned in this order from the Sun:</p>
          <p> 1. &nbsp;<b>Mercury</b>, 13 times a century Mercury can be observed from the Earth passing across the face of the Sun in an event called a transit, the next will occur on the 9th May 2016.</p>
           <p>2. &nbsp;<b>Venus</b>, which is also the second brightest object in the night sky after the moon.</p>
           <p>3. &nbsp;<b>Earth</b>, whose name comes from the Anglo-Saxon word erda which means ground or soil, formed  4.5 billion years ago.</p>
           <p>4. &nbsp;<b>Mars</b>, often described as the Red Planet has a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. </p>
           <p>5. &nbsp;<b>Jupiter</b>, primarily made of gases, is 2.5 times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined.</p>
           <p>6. &nbsp;<b>Saturn</b>, the most distant planet that can be seen with the naked eye.</p>
           <p>7. &nbsp;<b>Uranus</b>, the first planet discovered with the use of a telescope.</p>
           <p>8. &nbsp;<b>Neptune</b>, the furthest planet from the Sun, may have formed much closer to the Sun in early solar system history. </p>" data-am-custom-class="modal_margin"

    data-title="<h1>What Is The Solar System?</h1> 

<p>The Solar System is made up of all the planets that orbit our Sun. In addition to planets, the Solar System also consists of moons, comets, asteroids, minor planets, and dust and gas.</p>

<p>Everything in the Solar System orbits or revolves around the Sun. The Sun contains around 98% of all the material in the Solar System. The larger an object is, the more gravity it has. Because the Sun is so large, its powerful gravity attracts all the other objects in the Solar System towards it. At the same time, these objects, which are moving very rapidly, try to fly away from the Sun, outward into the emptiness of outer space. The result of the planets trying to fly away, at the same time that the Sun is trying to pull them inward is that they become trapped half-way in between. Balanced between flying towards the Sun, and escaping into space, they spend eternity orbiting around their parent star.</p>

<p>Scientists believe that the Solar System evolved from a giant cloud of dust and gas. They believe that this dust and gas began to collapse under the weight of its own gravity. As it did so, the matter contained within this could begin moving in a giant circle, much like the water in a drain moves around the center of the drain in a circle.</p>

<p>At the center of this spinning cloud, a small star began to form. This star grew larger and larger as it collected more and more of the dust and gas that collapsed into it.</p>

<p>Further away from the center of this mass where the star was forming, there were smaller clumps of dust and gas that were also collapsing. The star in the center eventually ignited forming our Sun, while the smaller clumps became the planets, minor planets, moons, comets, and asteroids.</p>"
